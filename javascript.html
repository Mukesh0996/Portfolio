            <small class="introduction">Introduction</small>
            <p class="content">JavaScript is also known as JS. It played a very important role in WWW. JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995, which appeared in Netscape, a popular browser of that time. The language was initially called LiveScript and was later renamed JavaScript is a client scripting language which is used for creating web pages. It is a standalone language developed in Netscape. It is an Object oriented Programming Language. JavaScript cannot run on its own. In fact, the browser is responsible for running JavaScript code.</p>
            <small class="introduction">How to start coding with JavaScript?</small>
            <p class="content">You need a text editor to write your code and a browser to display the web pages you develop. You can use a text editor of your choice including Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom or any other text editor. Web browser that supports JavaScript are Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer </p>
            <small class="introduction">Working of JavaScript in the browser and its advantages?</small>
            <p class="content">When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser and it is up to the browser to execute it. The main advantage of JavaScript is that all modern web browsers support. It is used when a webpage is to be made dynamic and add special effects on pages like rollover, roll out and many types of graphics. Users can write JavaScript code both internally in the HTML file or externally out side the HTML file. JavaScript is also used for client side validation of data before sending it to the server. This saves traffic on the server which avoids unnecessary load on a server. Using JavaScriptâ€™s we can add drop-down a list, sliders, etc. Like all programming languages, it consists of Control statements such as while and do while, Loops such as for loop, operators such as Arithmetic, Logical, Bit Wise operators and comparison operators, Conditional Statements and built in functions for effective programming etc. Java Script is built with Interpreter Centred which allows the user to get the output without the use of Compiler. That means the input performed by the user gets rendered directly without the compiling of codes.</p>
            <small class="introduction">Some of the JavaScript functions and how to write internal JS and external JS</small>
            <p class="content">Some of the built in functions are NAN(), Number(), parseFloat() and parseInt() etc. isNAN() Function is used to identify that input object is correct number format. parseFloat() function is used in the conversion of Int into Float. JavaScript code is written inside the <script></script> tags for internal JavaScript and for external JavaScript file, we use the same script tags and add an attribute as "SRC", which consits of the path. External javaScript files should be saved with the extension .js. With JavaScript you cannot control the data that is present in the server, only client side data can be controlled.
